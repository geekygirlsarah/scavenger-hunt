# Team Building (Remote) Scavenger Hunt!

Repo created Nov 10, 2021
Items last updated: Sep 2, 2020

## Sarah's notes:

My coworker Brianna and I came up with this at a previous job of mine, and it was such a good list that I kept it and have used it several times now. Someone wondered about the list and I decided to open source it!

I'm maintaining the original rules we came up with, but you may need to modify them:
* If you have a lot of people, you'll need to lower the points. If you have 10+ people, maybe lower it to 5. If you have over 20 people, make sure you can see them all on screen at the same time.
* If you don't have a lot of time (less than 20 minutes), you'll need to lower the point count.
* One person _can_ run this, however, if you have difficulty watching many people's video feeds at the same time, maybe find an assistant to help you watch as you do the calling of items and point tallying.
* Two monitors or an ultra-wide monitor helps with this a LOT! Use one monitor for the video, the other for the list and point tallying.
* I like [random.org](https://random.org) as you can have it give you a list of random numbers between 1 and 75 (the number of items in this list). If you want a list, choose Number at the top, then Integers. You may get duplicates, so be aware of that and just move to the next item.
* The more you add commentary, the more run it gets for the others that aren't playing.
* Let others talk about the items too! Ask them about the awards, or ask the pet's name, or where they got that weird postcard.

I'm willing to accept pull requests for more items, but I may not accept them if I feel they're too difficult to actually do in a remote scavenger hunt scenario. Final discretion for adding them is mine.

## Rules:

*	First person to display an item on camera gets a point
*	First person to 10 points wins
*	Items must be unique. (You can’t use the same item for multiple hunts)
*	You can interpret these however you like, however, if it’s too much of a stretch, we won’t award the point
*	None of the answers can be you or on you (so not your own clothing or anything)
*	We may award an additional bonus point to people with creative answers, as judged by us
*	Leave your computer (no running through the house with a laptop to be faster)
*	We will say the item, then say “Go!” and then you leave to get it. (Some are more specific and we want you to hear the whole thing)
*	Items are randomly chosen
*	Turn on your video to play, or turn it off if you're not playing
*	There’s a prize!
